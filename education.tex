    \item[Abstract]:
        Artificial Immune Systems are a field of Artificial Intelligence that
        developed on the early 90's, and remains subject to researches event
        today.  Beginning on computer security systems, algorithms based on the
        immune system have been used on many areas of computing. The power of
        abstraction the design of these systems as components of the natural
        immune system helped their development. Using a package of immune
        algorithms and the WEKA environment, this study will verify how the
        application of Artificial Immune Systems influences a computational
        system, comparing them with more traditional techniques from Data
        Mining and Artificial Intelligence.
