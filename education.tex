\textbf{Abstract}:
    Artificial Immune Systems are a field of Artificial Intelligence that
    developed on the early 90's, and remains subject to researches event today.
    Beginning on computer security systems, algorithms based on the immune
    system have been used on many areas of computing. The power of abstraction
    the design of these systems as components of the natural immune system
    helped their development. Using a package of immune algorithms and the WEKA
    environment, this study will verify how the application of Artificial
    Immune Systems influences a computational system, comparing them with more
    traditional techniques from Data Mining and Artificial Intelligence.
