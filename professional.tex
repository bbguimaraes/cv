\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Worked on the
        \href{https://prow.ci.openshift.org}{continuous integration system}, a
        highly parallel, distributed scheduler\slash executor built with
        OpenShift\slash Kubernetes clusters.
    \item
        Supported around 1k repositories, 80 organizations, 1k developers, 40k
        jobs, 250 compute nodes, 20k jobs\slash day, 5k ephemeral test
        clusters\slash day.
    \item
        Designed and implemented the current
        \href
            {https://github.com/openshift/ci-tools/blob/master/pkg/steps/multi_stage.go}
            {test DSL and executor},
        separating test scripts into discrete steps, allowing complex test
        scenarios, greatly simplifying them and making execution robust and
        intuitive.
    \item
        Transitioned a mostly legacy code base into a reliable and thoroughly
        tested project.
    \item
        Maintained performance of tools and services processing large amounts of
        data by constant analysis and optimization.
    \item
        Wrote extensive

\href{https://ucs.br}{Universidade de Caxias do Sul} (2012-2015), IT Dep.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
        Worked on the infrastructure and web applications serving 30k users
        (teachers, students, employees).
    \item
        Applications (Linux, Python, containers) and services (web servers,
        cache, task queues, databases), tools (CI, ticket system), integrated
        authentication.
